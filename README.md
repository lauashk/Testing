During my masters program in data science, I had the opportunity to collaborate on multiple group projects focused on various subject areas (in order of timeline):

1. Statistical Methods -  
Analyze a dataset of 1000 samples containing daily returns for an ETF, crude oil prices, gold prices, and JPMorgan stock. Calculate the sample mean, standard deviation, and correlations between each pair of variables using scipy, matplotlib, seaborn and statsmodels packages.

2. Linear Algebra
Spotify song popularity prediction - Our team used regression methods, such as Principal Linear Regression (PCR) and standard linear regression, to predict song popularity using song characteristics like loudness and tempo.

3. Machine Learning - Predictive Analysis for Heart Attack Predisposition through Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms
(to be uploaded)

4. Deep Learning
XG Boost overview - All students were tasked to give a short presentation about a ML algorithm to our fellow classmates and how it enhances the field of deep learning! From this paper written by Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin from U of Washington, XG Boost is an awesome supervised learning method using decision trees to form a single predictive model.

5. Big Data Technologies
Instacart analysis - Using an Instacart dataset comprised of 3M orders from 200K users, Tableau visualizations were created to understand item purchase popularity, time of orders, customer segmentation metrics, shopping patterns via Market Basket Analysis, and association rule mining to statistically confirm product recommendations for shoppers to add to customerâ€™s Instacart order

6. Generative AI
Visa Legal Advisor POC - In this prototype, my team created a chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for users to ask legal advice/consultation on H-1B visa process

7.Web Mining
Stock ETF Earning Calls Analysis - This project aimed to use automation, natural language processing, and analytics to extract insights from earnings calls to empower investors and contribute to finance, sentiment analysis, and student education.
